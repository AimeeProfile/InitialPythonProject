This programme still needs work but does not appear to produce any errors. The main body of the programme loops until the user chooses to exit.  

The purpose of this program is to give the user a suggestion for a videogame to play, based off of the options that they select.

The programme begins with a section that ensures the user input's their name as the 'name' variable.
The programme then asks for the user's age.  On inputting their age, the variable 'year'is created.  This is used to decide whether the user can use the programme and also whether their birth year was a leap year.  This then leads onto the main body of the programme.

The main body of the programme works by cycling through a selection of if / elif / else statements that are nestled within a while loop.
The while loop is broken only when the user wants to exit.
