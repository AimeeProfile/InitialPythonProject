This program still needs work but does not appear to produce any errors. The program can be launched from a single .py file. The main body of the program can be run without errors until the user terminates the program.  In the main body of the program, the user can navigate through multiple options which cause different lines of code to execute.

The purpose of this program is to give the user a suggestion for a videogame to play, based off of the options that they select.

The program begins with a section that ensures the user inputs their name as the 'name' variable.
The program then asks for the user's age.  On inputting their age, the variable 'year'is created.  This is used to decide whether the user can use the program and also whether their birth year was a leap year.  This then leads onto the main body of the program.

The main body of the program works by cycling through a selection of if / elif / else statements that are nestled within a while loop. 

Future developments should include adding relevant loops to the first section of the program.
